# Project Euler
Problem solving has always been a passion of mine, so in an effort to improve my Python skills I have decided to take on Project Euler.

Problems I am currently working on: 26, 31, 32, 145, 491

Topics I love: *pandigitals*, *palindromes*, *Python list comprehensions*

Right now my goal is to use brute force methods to work on getting more comfortable with Python syntactically. Any solutions that do not meet the under one minute requirement will get an algorithmic work-over in the future. 

Please be warned that Project Euler is meant to be a personal challenge for individuals interested in solving mathematical puzzles. It is not a competition, but an educational exercise for people who cannot stop learning. Using someone else's answers is only hurting yourself.

And with that, spoilers ahead :)

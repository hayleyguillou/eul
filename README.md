# Project Euler
Problem solving has always been a passion of mine, so in an effort to improve my Python skills I have decided to take on Project Euler.

Please be warned that Project Euler is meant to be a personal challenge for individuals interested in solving mathematical puzzles. It is not a competition, but an educational exercise for people who cannot stop learning. Using someone else's answers is only hurting yourself.

And with that, spoilers ahead :)
